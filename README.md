In this homework I a web application that plays a short javascript quiz game. This quiz is made up of 4 html pages, the end html, game html, highscores html. The index page gives the user two clickable buttons to either play the quiz or view the high scores. When clicking play, the user is taken to the game html page which contains it's own java script as well as css page to style the 4 choices provided and the question. Also on the game page there's a progress bar, score keeper, and a count down timer starting at 60 sec. Once finished the user is taken to the end html which also has it's own js and css page. In the end.html page the user can save their highscore by typing in their name and clicking save. Then the user can play the game again or view leaderboards within the highscores button.
